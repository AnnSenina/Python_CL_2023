Perfect roast turkey,180,10 serving(s),"['20ml/¾fl oz rapeseed oil', '1 x 5kg/11lb good-quality free-range turkey, preferably organically reared, wishbone removed (ask your butcher to remove the wings and neck and chop them into 2.5cm/1in pieces to use in the dish)', '40g/1½oz unsalted butter, softened to room temperature', '2 pinches sea salt flakes', '2 pinches freshly ground white pepper', '200ml/7fl oz water', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1-2 tsp ground arrowroot (depending on how thick you like your gravy), dissolved in 1 tbsp cold water', 'roast potatoes and steamed seasonal vegetables, to serve']","Remove the turkey from the fridge and bring to room temperature - this will take at least an hour.
When you are ready to cook, preheat the oven to 230C/220C Fan/Gas 8.
Heat the rapeseed oil in a large, heavy-based roasting tray on the stove top. Add the chopped turkey wings and neck and fry for 8-10 minutes, turning the pieces over every 2-3 minutes, or until evenly browned all over.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soften the butter with the back of a dessert spoon, then season with the salt and freshly ground white pepper. Using a pastry brush or your hands, smear the seasoned butter all over the turkey. Add any remaining butter to the roasting tray once the chopped wings and neck have browned.
Place the turkey on top of the wing and neck pieces, then roast in the oven for 30 minutes.
Remove the turkey from the oven and baste all over with the cooking juices.
Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/150C Fan/Gas 3.
Pour the water into the roasting tray, then return the turkey to the oven and continue to cook for a further 1 hour, basting the bird with the cooking juices every 20 minutes (do this quickly to prevent the heat escaping from the oven).
At the end of the cooking time, test that the turkey is cooked through by inserting a skewer or roasting fork into the thickest part of its thigh; if the juices run clear, the meat is cooked. Alternatively, use a meat thermometer; if cooked, the temperature should be 65C for 10 minutes, or up to 74C for 2 minutes. If the turkey is not fully cooked, return it to the oven until the juices run clear.
Remove the turkey from the oven and transfer the bird to a large, deep-sided tray, reserving the roasting tray the turkey was cooked in along with the cooking juices. Set the turkey aside to rest for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 1½ hours.
While the turkey is resting, cook your roast potatoes and vegetable dishes.
When you’re almost ready to serve the meal, return the roasting tray used to cook the turkey to the stove top. Bring the cooking juices to the boil over a medium heat, scraping up any burned bits from the bottom of the tray using a wooden spoon.
Collect the juices released by the turkey as it was resting and add them to the gravy. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed.
Reduce the heat until the gravy is simmering, then stir in the dissolved arrowroot and cook until the gravy has thickened.
Strain the gravy through a fine sieve into a warmed jug. Keep warm.
To serve, bring the turkey to the table and carve into slices. Serve with the roast potatoes and vegetables. Pour over the gravy.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/the_perfect_roast_turkey_01155_16x9.jpg
Stuffed roast turkey breast,180,8 serving(s),"['1 tbsp sunflower oil', '1 onion, finely chopped', '1 leek, trimmed and finely sliced', '4 pork sausages, around 275g/9¾oz', '50g/1¾oz dried cranberries', '25g/1oz flaked almonds', '1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated zest only', '1 heaped tbsp roughly chopped fresh thyme leaves', '40g/1½oz dried white breadcrumbs', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1.5kg/3lb 5oz turkey breast joint, fully thawed if frozen', '16 rashers smoked streaky bacon', '2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling', 'fresh thyme and bay leaves, to garnish', '2 tbsp plain flour', 'splash of wine', '450ml/16fl oz chicken stock, made with 1 chicken stock cube', '1 tbsp redcurrant jelly']","To make the stuffing, heat the oil and gently fry the onion and leek for 5 minutes, or until well softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly. Tip into a mixing bowl and leave to cool for 30 minutes.
For the turkey, generously oil a small, sturdy roasting tin, roughly 30cm x 22cm/12 x 8½in – the turkey needs to fit snugly.
To continue the stuffing, once the onion and leek are cool, add the cranberries, almonds, lemon zest, thyme and breadcrumbs. Squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins and add it to the bowl.
Season with salt and lots of pepper. Mix well with a spoon or with clean hands until thoroughly combined.
Place the turkey breast on a board and gently remove the skin. Turn over and cut horizontally almost all the way through the thickest part of the breast and open up like a book, so that the turkey has a flatter, more oblong shape. Cover with a sheet of cling film and bash with a rolling pin until around 2.5cm/1in thick all over.
Place a sheet of cling film on a work surface and put eight pieces of kitchen string, each 50cm/20in long, roughly 4cm/1½in apart along its length. Stretch each rasher of bacon with the back of a knife until around 32cm/13in long. Place the bacon rashers on top of the string and cling film, overlapping each slice.
Place the turkey breast, smooth-side down, on top of the bacon and arrange the filling all the way down its length. Bring up the cling film and bacon on both long sides to enclose the filling.
Tie firmly with the string and discard the cling film. Place the turkey parcel in the prepared tin, knot-side down. (You can cover and chill for up to 24 hours before cooking if using a fresh turkey joint, or cook the same day if using a previously frozen joint.)
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Uncover the stuffed turkey joint, then drizzle with oil and season with black pepper. Cover loosely with foil and roast for 1 hour. Remove the foil and continue cooking for a further 30–45 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp and the turkey and stuffing are thoroughly cooked.
Transfer the turkey to a warmed platter. Cover with foil and a tea towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes.
For the gravy, put the roasting tin on the hob over medium heat and stir in the flour. Add the wine and cook for 15–20 seconds, stirring constantly.
Gradually add the stock, stirring all the time. Bring the liquid to a simmer, stir in the redcurrant jelly and cook for 2 minutes, or until thickened and glossy. Season to taste, strain carefully (the tin will be extremely hot) through a sieve into a saucepan and keep warm until ready to serve.
Snip the string off the turkey and garnish with bay leaves and thyme. Carve into slices and serve with the hot gravy.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/roast_turkey_crown_10545_16x9.jpg
Nigella's turkey breast with Christmas stuffing,150,12 serving(s),"['100g/3½oz dried cranberries', '100ml/3½fl oz Marsala', '2 tbsp olive oil', '2 banana shallots, finely chopped', '¼ tsp ground cloves', '½ tsp ground allspice', '2 tsp chopped fresh sage', '1kg/2lb 4oz Italian sausages', '2 free-range eggs, beaten', '50g/2oz parmesan, grated', '60g/2¼oz breadcrumbs', '5kg/11lb double breast turkey joint, boned, butterflied, with skin left on', '4 tbsp duck or goose fat']","Put the cranberries and Marsala into a small saucepan and bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to one side.
Put the oil into a large frying pan or similar heavy-based pan, and fry the shallots for a minute or so, then add the spices and shredded sage, turning them in the soft shallots.
Squeeze the sausagemeat out of its skins, add to the pan and break it up – using a wooden fork and spatula for ease – turning it in the hot pan until it loses its pinkness. This will take about five minutes.
Take the frying pan off the heat and turn the contents into a large bowl, mixing in the steeped cranberries and any Marsala clinging to them, and leave to cool. You can cover with cling film and put in the fridge for up to two days at this stage.
When you are ready to stuff the turkey breast, take the bowl of sausagement out of the fridge.
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Uncover the bowl of sausagemeat, add the eggs, parmesan and breadcrumbs and – I use my hands for this – mix well.
Lay the butterflied turkey joint out in front of you. It really does look like a butterfly though admittedly a fleshy one. Spread the stuffing out first in the slight cavity in the centre of the butterfly and then outwards onto the wings though not going right up to the edge (or it will squodge out when cooking) but as evenly as possible over the whole joint.
Carefully, in one swift but steady movement, fold one ‘wing’ over the other to close the joint, and then sit the turkey on a large roasting tin, breast bone (or where the breast bone would be) uppermost as it would look were it the whole bird, with the pointier bit furthest away from you. Thread two skewers through the base – i.e., the widest part that is nearer you – to keep it closed and smear it all over with the duck or goose fat.
Roast the turkey breast for 2-2½ hours, then check it is cooked with a turkey or meat thermometer. When cooked, it should read 75C. (If you’re leaving it to rest, as you should or to cool, you could take it out at 73C – it wil retain heat and continue to cook for a short while once out of the oven.)
Flex your muscles, then lift out onto a carving board, and leave to rest for at least 20 minutes. Or leave to get cold if you are eating it as part of a buffet.
Cut through the whole joint in wide slices right across; they will need to be quite thick, at least 1-2cm/½-1in, to keep the stuffing intact within the slice.
As you place it on table or sideboard, dot around it the condiments of your choice: I revert to Christmas in Italy here by putting a lusciously extravagant pot or two of Italian mostarda di Cremona on the table alongside: this is a hot and sweet preserve of mustardy candied fruits that gleam beautifully and taste both festive and fabulous.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/turkey_breast_stuffed_43707_16x9.jpg
Gordon Ramsay's roast turkey crown,120,8 serving(s),"['125g/4½oz pack unsalted butter, softened', '3-4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only', 'sprig of fresh rosemary, chopped leaves only', '2 tbsp fresh parsley leaves, chopped', 'salt', 'freshly ground black pepper', '2.2kg/4lb 14oz medium-sized turkey crown', '125g/4½oz butter', '1 onion, finely chopped', 'large sprig of thyme and rosemary, chopped leaves only', '200g/7oz white breadcrumbs', '6 fresh sage leaves', '1 lemon, zest only', '50g/2oz pine nuts', '1 tsp sea salt', 'freshly ground black pepper', '3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped', '1 onion or large shallot, chopped', '2 tbsp olive oil', '125ml/4fl oz dry white wine', '1 sprig fresh thyme', '1 bay leaf', '500ml/17fl oz chicken stock', '200ml/7fl oz double cream', 'sea salt', 'freshly ground black pepper']","Pre-heat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
For the herb butter, mix herbs and butter together to form a paste, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Lift up the skin of the turkey with your fingers and separate it from the flesh. Divide the herb butter and spread it under the skin. Season well, place in a roasting tin.
Cook the crown for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and cook the turkey for 1½ hours, or until the juices run clear. Cover the turkey with foil and tea towels and set aside in a warm place to rest for 30 minutes before carving, reserve the juices for the gravy.
For the stuffing, melt butter in a large frying pan and gently sauté onion for 10 minutes until soft. Stir in the herbs for 1 minute then add breadcrumbs to absorb the butter. Mix in the lemon zest, pine nuts and seasoning and cook over medium heat for about seven minutes until crumbs start to brown and crisp. Take off the heat, mix in the parsley and serve warm.
For the gravy, gently fry the onion in the olive oil for about five minutes. Pour in the wine and add the thyme and bay and boil until the volume of the liquid is reduced by three-quarters.
Add stock and boil until reduced by half then add cream and boil for further five minutes. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat, cool for ten minutes and strain. Add the turkey pan juices, boil for two minutes, season with salt and strain.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/roastturkeyandstuffi_71053_16x9.jpg
Roast turkey crown,180,8 serving(s),"['1 turkey breast crown (a wingless, legless turkey)', '50g/2oz butter', 'salt and pepper', 'about 10 rashers streaky bacon']","Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.
Rub the butter all over the bird and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Then lay the bacon rashers over the bird, more or less covering it completely. The job of the bacon is twofold: to help keep the breast basted without you having to open (and therefore cool) the oven every ten minutes; and to buy you time, so the skin doesn't burn before the breast is cooked through.
Place the bird in a roasting tray in the centre of the oven. Cook on this high heat for 25-30 minutes until the bacon is almost burnt.
Remove the bacon from the breast of the bird and put on one side. Baste the breast of the bird with the fat and juices in the pan and return to the oven. Turn down the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and continue to cook for about 12 minutes per 1kg/2¼lb, protecting the skin with buttered foil only if it seems to need it. Cook until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the breast is pierced with a skewer and the skin is brown and crispy. Cooked like this even a big bird (say 6-7kg/13½-15¾lb legless weight) shouldn't take more than 1½-2 hours in total.
Serve slices of roast turkey breast and spoonfuls of the leg meat in their rich gravy, with all the usual trimmings: roast potatoes, bread sauce, steamed sprouts, chipolatas wrapped in bacon and stuffing.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/roastleglessturkey_13963_16x9.jpg
Roast turkey roll,150,8 serving(s),"['100g/3½oz pork scratchings', '100g/3½oz sourdough bread, broken into pieces and baked until crisp', '100g/3½oz shelled pistachios, roughly chopped', '50g/1¾oz dried cranberries, roughly chopped', '2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves', '1 orange, zest only', '800g/1lb 12oz sausage meat', '400g/14oz onion, finely chopped and fried until translucent, cooled', '100g/3½oz cooked and peeled chestnuts, finely chopped', '160g/5½oz fresh breadcrumbs', '1 bunch fresh sage, chopped', '2 tsp salt', '3 tsp cracked black pepper', '100g/3½oz dried cranberries', '1 tbsp juniper berries, crushed', '20 rashers smoked streaky bacon (approximately 250-300g/9-10½oz)', '2-2.2kg/4lb 8oz-5lb boneless and skinless turkey breast', '140g/5oz brown sauce', 'bread sauce, to serve']","For the crumble topping, crush the pork scratchings and the sourdough pieces in a bowl. Add the pistachios, cranberries and thyme. Mix with your hands and set aside in a covered container.
For the stuffing, mix together all the ingredients apart from the bacon. Mix to combine.
Trim any bits of fat or membrane from the turkey. With a sharp knife, open out the turkey breast as if you are butterflying it. Place the turkey between two sheets of cling film and flatten it out a little with a rolling pin.
Cut two large pieces of aluminium foil and lay the turkey breast on top. Season with salt and pepper. Spread a generous dollop the stuffing mix in a 5mm/¼in layer onto the turkey breast and then use the foil to help you roll it up like a Swiss roll. Completely encase the turkey in the two layers of foil and secure with cook's string at regular intervals along the length of the roll. Place in the fridge until needed.
Preheat the oven to 120C/250F/Gas ½.
Add 400ml/14fl oz boiling water to a deep roasting tin. Place a wire rack in the tin and place the rolled turkey breast on top. Cover the roasting tin with aluminium foil.
Roast in the oven for 1½-2 hours, then check the core temperature with a meat thermometer. You are looking for a temperature of 70C/160F. If it is not ready, place back into the oven and continue to cook until it reaches 70C/160F. Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover with aluminium foil and set aside to rest for 40 minutes. When cool enough to handle, remove the string and foil.
For the stuffing, preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3 and line a terrine mould or flameproof bowl with the streaky bacon, leaving some excess hanging over the sides. Pack the mould with the remaining stuffing mix and wrap the bacon over the top.
Bake in the oven for 45 minutes, or until the middle has reached 70C/160F on a meat thermometer. When cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, turn out the stuffing and pat dry. Heat the grill to hot, then grill the stuffing until the bacon is crisp.
When rested, remove the turkey from the roasting tin and brush a thick layer of brown sauce over the top. Cover with the Christmas crumble mix, top with a little orange zest and serve straight away with the stuffing.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/toms_turkey_roll_with_44115_16x9.jpg
Roast turkey and stuffing,150,12 serving(s),"['4.5-5.5kg/10-12lb whole turkey, with giblets', '1 onion, halved', '1 carrot', '2 celery sticks', '2 sprigs of fresh parsley', '2 sprigs of fresh thyme', '175g/6oz butter', 'flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper', '85g/3oz butter', '175g/6oz onions, finely chopped', '225g/8oz fresh white breadcrumbs', '2½ tbsp chopped mixed fresh herbs (parsley, chives, thyme or sage)', '1.2 litres/2 pints stock (see above, or chicken stock)', '1 tbsp softened butter', '1-2 tbsp plain flour']","For the stock, put the giblets, onion, carrot, celery and herbs in a saucepan and season. Cover with about 2 litres/3½ pints cold water and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours, or until you have a flavoursome stock. Strain and set aside for making the gravy. (The stock can be made a day or two in advance; cover and store in the fridge, then skim any fat from the top.)
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. For the stuffing, melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. When it is foaming, add the chopped onions and season. Cover with greaseproof paper and a lid, turn the heat to low and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until completely softened. Set aside to cool.
Put the cooled onions in a mixing bowl. Mix in the breadcrumbs and mixed herbs and season to taste. Weigh the stuffing to assist with calculating the cooking time.
Season the turkey cavity at both ends. Stuff some of the stuffing into the main cavity, but be careful not to pack it in - there must be enough space between the stuffing and breastbone to fit the handle of a wooden spoon. Stuff the smaller cavity at the neck end, again leaving a little space. Put the turkey into a large roasting tray. Melt the 175g/6oz butter, then soak the muslin in the butter and wrap it over the turkey.
To calculate the cooking time, add the weight of the turkey and stuffing together. Roast for 15 minutes, then turn the oven down to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and roast for 15 minutes per 450g/1lb of the total weight. Baste with the juices every 30 minutes; it is important to do this quickly so as to not let the turkey cool down, as this could alter the cooking time. Remove the muslin 15 minutes before the end of roasting and baste again.
To test if the turkey is cooked, insert a small fruit or vegetable knife into the thicktest part of the meat, between the leg and breast; the juices that run should be clear, with no sign of pink; if there is any pink, return the turkey to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. Tranfer the turkey to a carving dish. Cover it with parchment paper, then place a clean tea-towel over it to keep it nice and snug. Leave it to rest for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1½ hours.
Meanwhile, for the gravy, skim off the fat from the roasting tray with a spoon. Place the tray on a medium heat and deglaze it by pouring in the stock. Using a whisk, scrape free all the caramelised bits on the bottom of the tray. Bring the mixture to the boil, then carefully pour it into a saucepan through a sieve and season.
To thicken the gravy, mix together the butter and flour, then whisk it into the gravy. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove from the heat.
Carve the turkey and serve on warm plates with the stuffing and hot gravy.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/perfect_roast_turkey_72482_16x9.jpg

Put on the lid, turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for half an hour. Strain the milk through a fine sieve into a clean pan, pressing down with a spoon to extract all the liquid.
Add the cream to the milk mixture and gently heat. Whisk in the breadcrumbs. Leave for a few moments to allow the crumbs to swell. Season to taste with more salt and then pour the sauce into a bowl. Cover with a plate and keep warm over a pan of hot, but not boiling water, until needed.
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Rub half of the oil over the chicken and sprinkle with plenty of salt, set aside. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a roomy casserole dish and lightly brown the chopped chicken wings and giblets over a medium heat. Place the prepared chicken on top, sitting it between the wings and giblets. Add pepper and the vermouth. Roast for ten minutes.
Decrease the oven temperature to 180/160C Fan/Gas 4 and cook the chicken for a further 45 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes, depending on the weight of the chicken. Check the chicken is cooked by inserting a skewer into the thickest part of the meat – if the juices run clear, the bird is cooked.
Meanwhile remove the skins from the sausages and wrap in the bacon. Place into a small roasting dish and cook alongside the chicken for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are sizzling and nicely browned. Set aside and keep warm.
Remove the chicken from the oven. Transfer it to a warm plate first letting the juices drip back into the roasting pan it was cooked in. Cover the chicken with foil and leave it somewhere warm to rest.
Add the chicken stock to the roasting pan and simmer over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring in all the caramelised browned bits on the roasting tin. Strain and return the gravy to the roasting tin. Place on a medium heat on the stove.
Add the cooked, peeled potatoes to the gravy and turn them to coat in the juices. Transfer to the oven for at least 20 minutes or until golden-brown.

Season the venison with salt and pepper and fry for about 20 seconds on each side, or until sealed and golden-brown but not cooked. Remove and set aside to cool.
Reduce the heat to low, add the onions to the pan and fry for few minutes. Cover with a lid and cook for 15–20 minutes, or until soft and golden.
Remove the lid and fry for a minute to drive off any liquid. Remove half the onions with a slotted spoon and set aside (this will be used for the gravy later). Add the sugar, vinegar and thyme to the onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until sticky. Leave to cool completely.
Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured work surface until it is very thin – about 25x35cm/10x14in. Trim the edges to neaten. Brush the surface of the pastry with the mustard, sit the browned fillet in the centre and spoon over the sticky balsamic onions.
Fold up the ends and bring over the sides, trim any excess if there are double layers of pastry, and brush with beaten egg. Use the pastry trimmings to cut out three leaves and arrange in the centre of the Wellington, then glaze them with egg. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour, along with any remaining beaten egg.
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. You will need a large baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper preheated in the oven so that it is piping hot.
Brush the Wellington with the remaining beaten egg. Sit it on the hot baking tray and roast for 20–25 minutes, or until golden-brown. Leave to rest for 5–10 minutes before carving.

The ultimate Christmas roast beef,120,8 serving(s),"['225g/8oz plain flour', '8 free-range eggs', '600ml/20fl oz milk', 'sea salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 cauliflower, cut into large florets', '300g/10½oz French beans, trimmed', '1 broccoli, cut into large florets', '8 carrots, peeled and cut into batons', '2.75kg/6lb 2oz whole beef sirloin, fat and sinew trimmed', '250g/9oz beef dripping or lard', '200ml/7fl oz red wine', '1 litre/1¾ pints beef stock', '2kg/4lb 8oz large floury potatoes such as King Edward, each peeled and cut into 2 or 3 pieces', '200g/7oz smoked streaky bacon slices, cut into lardons', '500g/1lb 2oz Brussels sprouts, trimmed and finely shredded', '250g/9oz cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped', '175g/6oz butter']","First prepare the Yorkshire pudding batter. Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre, then whisk in the eggs one at a time, bringing in the flour from the insides of the well as you do so.
Gradually whisk in the milk until the batter is smooth and well combined. Season with salt and pepper, then cover the bowl and chill in the fridge overnight.
You can also prepare the vegetables a day in advance. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Prepare a large bowl of iced water. Add the cauliflower florets to the boiling water and boil for 4-5 minutes, or until perfectly tender. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and plunge into the bowl of iced water. Set aside until the florets have cooled (this will prevent them from continuing to cook). Drain, transfer to a roasting tray and set aside.
Repeat the process with the French beans, simmering them for just 2-3 minutes. Add the drained, cooled beans to the tray.
Repeat the process with the broccoli florets, simmering them for 1-2 minutes. Add the drained, cooled broccoli to the tray.
Repeat the process with the carrot batons, simmering them for 6-7 minutes. Add the drained, cooled carrot to the tray.
This will ensure you have all the vegetables prepared and perfectly cooked ready to reheat on the day. Chill all of the vegetables, covered, in the roasting tray (or in a re-sealable food bag or plastic container) until needed.
On Christmas Day, prepare the beef. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Score the fat of the beef in a criss-cross pattern using a sharp knife, then season the beef generously with salt and pepper.
Heat a frying pan over a high heat. When the pan is very hot, add 25g/1oz of the beef dripping and, when it has melted, fry the beef on all sides until browned all over.
Place the beef joint, fat side facing downwards, into a roasting tray and roast for 45-50 minutes (for medium-rare) or longer until cooked to your liking – although bear in mind that the meat will continue to cook as it rests. Turn the beef joint halfway through the cooking time. When the beef is cooked to your liking, transfer it to a large plate, cover with aluminium foil and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile for the gravy, return the frying pan containing the meat juices to a medium heat and, when it is hot, add the wine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and continue to simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half.
Add the beef stock and return the mixture to a simmer, simmering until the volume of liquid has reduced by one-third, then season with salt and pepper. Strain the gravy into a jug or gravy boat. Cover and keep warm until needed (you may need to reheat it before serving).
Next, make the roast potatoes. Place the potatoes into a large saucepan, cover with cold water, add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering and simmer the potatoes for 3-4 minutes. Drain the potatoes using a colander and shake them around a little in the colander to roughen the edges. Set aside.
When the beef has only 35 minutes left to cook, put 100g/3½oz of the remaining beef dripping or lard into a deep-sided roasting tray. Heat the fat in the oven for 5 minutes, or until smoking hot.
Carefully add the cooked, drained potatoes to the hot fat, making sure you keep your face as far away from the roasting tray as possible in case the fat spits. Season the potatoes with sea salt, then return the roasting tray to the oven. Roast the potatoes with the beef for 30 minutes, or until they are starting to turn golden-brown and crisp.
Turn the potatoes over after you remove the beef from the oven, then increase the oven temperature to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and roast the potatoes for a further 30 minutes.
As soon as you have turned the potatoes over, divide 100g/3¾oz of the remaining dripping or lard equally among the holes of two 12-hole muffin tins or Yorkshire pudding tins. Heat the fat in the oven for 10 minutes, or until smoking hot.
Meanwhile, transfer the Yorkshire pudding batter to a jug. Carefully pour the Yorkshire pudding batter into the tins, filling each hole two-thirds full. Bake the Yorkshire puddings in the oven with the roast potatoes for the final 20 minutes that the potatoes should have left to cook, making sure you do not reopen the oven door.
After 20 minutes, open the oven door slightly to allow any steam to escape. Remove the potatoes, which should be ready now (prick them with a sharp knife to check they are tender in the middle). Transfer to a serving dish and keep warm.
Reduce the oven temperature to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Continue to cook the Yorkshire puddings at this temperature for a further 12-15 minutes, or until crisp, risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a serving dish and keep warm.
For the Brussels sprouts, heat the remaining dripping or lard in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.
Add the sprouts and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until just wilted. Add the chopped chestnuts, half of the butter and 2 tablespoons of water, then stir-fry until the chestnuts have heated through and the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
Finally, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, add all of the blanched vegetables and simmer for 30 seconds, or until heated through. Drain well and transfer to a serving platter, dotted with the remaining butter.
Serve the beef on a platter, surrounded by the roast potatoes on one side and the Brussels sprouts on the other. Serve the vegetables on a separate platter and the sauce in a gravy boat.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/the_ultimate_christmas_34876_16x9.jpg
Beef Wellington,120,8 serving(s),"['1.3kg/2lb 14oz middle-cut fillet of beef', '1 tbsp oil', '1½ x 375g packets all-butter puff pastry', 'plain flour, for dusting', '1 egg, beaten with a dash of milk', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'large knob of butter', '350g/12oz mixed mushrooms (such as button, chestnut, wild), thinly sliced', '50g/1¾oz Parmesan, finely grated', '1 tbsp finely chopped tarragon', '2 tsp Dijon mustard', '1 egg yolk', 'small knob of butter', '100g/3½oz button mushrooms, finely sliced', '1 tbsp plain flour', '400ml/14fl oz full-fat crème fraîche', '1 tbsp Dijon mustard', '1 tbsp freshly chopped tarragon', 'a pinch sugar']","Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.
Season the beef with salt and pepper. Place a large frying pan over a high heat, add the oil and fry the beef on all sides until browned. Transfer to a baking tray and roast in the oven for 15–18 minutes. Turn the oven off and remove the beef. Leave to cool, reserving any cooking juices, and then chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour (see tip).
Next make the topping. Melt the butter in the same pan and fry the mushrooms over a high heat for 5–10 minutes – you may need to do this in batches. Tip the mushrooms into a sieve set over a bowl to collect the juices and reserve these for the sauce. Transfer the mushrooms to another bowl and allow to cool before mixing with the Parmesan, tarragon, mustard and egg yolk. Season with salt and pepper and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with baking paper. Sit the single 375g packet of pastry on a floured work surface and roll out to a square about 40cm/16in in size, then transfer it to the baking sheet. Place the cooked beef to one side of the pastry and spoon the mushroom mixture on top. Fold over the ends of the pastry and then fold the longest edge over the beef, sealing along the side with a little of the egg wash. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. While it is chilling, preheat the oven again to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.
Brush the top of the chilled beef Wellington with egg wash. Roll out the remaining half block of pastry and cut into 8 thin strips: lay 4 strips diagonally, and evenly spaced, across the top of the beef Wellington, and 4 strips across these to create a lattice pattern. Brush the lattice with egg wash and then roast in the oven for 30–35 minutes or until the pastry is golden-brown and crisp.
Meanwhile, make the tarragon sauce. Melt the butter in the same frying pan and fry the mushrooms over a high heat for 5–10 minutes or until the juices evaporate. Sprinkle in the flour and add the crème fraîche with the reserved mushroom juices (from the topping), the mustard and tarragon. Season with salt, pepper and sugar and bring to the boil, stirring. Simmer for 3 minutes until reduced slightly and add any beef juices from the original baking tray. Keep hot.
Allow the beef Wellington to rest, covered with foil, for 15 minutes before carving. Slice into thick slices and serve with the hot tarragon sauce.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/beef_wellington_with_35577_16x9.jpg

For the roast pork belly, put the pork belly in a roasting tray, skin-side up. Thoroughly pat it dry with kitchen paper, then rub sea salt all over the skin. Set aside for 20 minutes.
Roast the pork belly for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 160C/140C fan/Gas 3 and continue to cook for a further 1½ hours. When cooked, set the pork aside to rest in a warm place.
Meanwhile, for the rib gravy, heat the oil in large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the pork ribs and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, turning them regularly until they have caramelised all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Add the onions and carrots to the pan, then pour over the stock. Bring to the boil, scraping any burned bits up from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon.
Return the browned pork ribs to the pan, then add the peppercorns, bay leaves and thyme. Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, then continue to simmer gently for 1½ hours.
Meanwhile, for the apple bread sauce, heat the milk in a large saucepan. Stud the onion with 3 of the cloves and add to the hot milk. Stud one of the apples with the remaining 2 cloves and add to the pan along with the cinnamon stick. As the milk starts to bubble, turn off the heat, cover the pan with a lid and leave to infuse for at least 30 minutes. Once infused, discard the apple, onion, cloves and cinnamon stick.
Add the breadcrumbs and butter to the infused milk, stir well and heat gently. Just before serving, grate in the remaining apple and stir in the ground cinnamon.
When the cooking time for the pork ribs has elapsed, remove the ribs and slide the meat from the bone. Chop the meat and return it to the gravy mixture.
To serve, carve the pork belly and arrange the slices onto a serving platter. Serve the rib gravy in a large jug alongside and the apple bread sauce in a large serving bowl.

Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer the gammon and vegetables gently for 20 minutes per 500g/1lb 2oz. (If your pan is not quite large enough to cover the joint completely, turn the gammon over halfway through the cooking time.)
Remove the gammon from the water and set aside to cool for 15 minutes. (The cooking liquid can be strained and reserved for making soup for another time.)
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a large roasting tin with kitchen foil.
Use a small knife to remove the rind from the gammon joint, leaving as much of the fat intact as possible. Score the fat in a diamond pattern, and push a clove into the centre of each 'X'.
Place the gammon into the foil-lined roasting tray, ensuring that the sides of the foil come halfway up the joint to contain any roasting juices.
For the glaze, mix the honey and mustard together and brush half of it evenly over the gammon, including one side of the joint. Roast in the centre of the oven for 10 minutes, then take the joint out and brush the top and remaining side with the rest of the glaze. Return the gammon to the oven for a further 10– 15 minutes, rotating the tin so that the opposite side of the gammon faces the back of the oven.
The gammon is ready when the fat on top is glossy and golden brown. Cover loosely with foil if the top begins to look too brown. Remove the gammon from the oven and set aside to rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Layer the potatoes and onions in an large roasting dish, seasoning each layer with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour over the stock, flattening the top layer down.
Place the potatoes onto the lower shelf in the oven.
Pierce the duck skin all over with a fork and stuff the neck end of the cavity with the satsuma halves and cinnamon stick. Rub the five-spice powder all over the skin and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Place the duck directly onto the oven rack above the potatoes, so that the juices from the duck will drip onto the potatoes as they cook. If your dish with the potatoes is on the small side, it may be useful to put a very large empty tray on the bottom of the oven to catch any drips of fat.
Roast for 1½-2 hours, or until the duck is cooked through and the potatoes are tender and golden-brown.
Meanwhile, for the spiced cranberry apple sauce, bring the apples, cranberries and cider to the boil in a frying pan. Reduce the heat until simmering and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries have burst and the mixture has thickened.

Place the goose on a rack over a large sturdy roasting tin and prick with a skewer a few times down each side just below the wing. Season the goose well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Put the quartered onion and three bay leavers into the goose body cavity and cover the legs with folded triangles of foil. Roast the goose for one hour, then take it out of the oven and put on a board. Carefully drain the fat from the roasting tin into a large heatproof bowl.
Reduce the oven temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.
Cook the goose for another hour, removing the foil after 30 minutes so the legs can brown. (If your goose is very fatty, you may need to remove it from the oven and drain the fat one more time during the last hour of cooking.)
To test when the goose is cooked, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer, then press the skewer against the leg and check the juices that run out. When the goose is cooked, the juices should run clear.
Remove the goose from the oven and transfer to a warmed serving platter. Cover loosely with foil and a couple of dry tea towels. Leave to rest for 25-30 minutes.
Increase the oven temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Meanwhile, for the stock and stuffing, separate the liver from the rest of the giblets. Pat dry on kitchen paper and cut into small pieces, discarding any sinew or damaged parts. Put in a small bowl, cover and chill until ready to use.

Place the eating apples alongside the stuffing. Brush the cut-side of each apple with a little more oil. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the stuffing is golden-brown and cooked through.
For the gravy, hold the roasting tin with a dry tea towel at one end, so all the cooking juices run to the corner. Remove as much of the goose fat as possible.
Place the roasting tin over a medium heat and stir in the flour until thoroughly combined. Slowly stir in the cider and the goose stock. Bring to the boil, stirring constantly and scraping up the sediment from the bottom of the pan. Pour into a saucepan and return to a simmer, stirring with a whisk to break up any floury lumps. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally then season with plenty of salt and pepper. Strain though a fine sieve into a warmed jug.

Lay the pork out, skin-side down, and rub the paste over the pork, then roll it up as tightly as you can and secure at intervals with butcher’s twine.
If you have time leave in the fridge, uncovered or loosely wrapped in kitchen towel overnight – or even better, for two nights, to give the flavours time to permeate the meat and to let the skin dry out.
An hour before you are ready to start cooking the pork, remove it from the fridge so it can return to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 150C/130C Fan/Gas 2.
Arrange the potatoes and onion slices on the base of a large roasting tin and season with salt. Pour over the white wine (or cider) and stock (or water).
Make sure the rind of the pork is dry and season it with salt. Place on top of the potatoes and onions. Cover with foil and put in the oven. Roast for four hours until the pork is cooked through – the internal temperature should read 68C/154F (use a meat thermometer to check this).
Turn the heat up to its highest setting and cook for a further half an hour to crisp up the skin. Remove from the oven and transfer the meat and potatoes to separate serving dishes. Leave the meat to rest for half an hour, uncovered, but keep the potatoes warm.
To make the spiced apple sauce, put all the ingredients in a saucepan with a splash of water, then cook gently for around 10 minutes, or until the apples have softened and broken down into a purée. Taste and adjust the flavours if necessary – you may need a little more sugar.

Wash the spinach in plenty of water and put into a saucepan. Heat gently until it has wilted down, stirring a couple of times, then drain over a sieve. Leave to cool, then roughly chop.
Put the cranberries into a small saucepan and cover with the sherry. Bring to the boil, remove from the heat and set aside until the cranberries have plumped up and absorbed most of the sherry.
Heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook over a medium heat until any liquid coming out of the mushrooms has evaporated and the onion has softened. Add the parsnip and continue to cook until the parsnip has reduced in volume and the onion has started to caramelise. Add the garlic, dried sage, thyme and lemon zest, then cook for a couple more minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
Put the freekah or spelt into a large bowl along with the mixed nuts, chestnuts, breadcrumbs, spinach, cooked vegetables and the eggs. Season well with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly.

Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the leeks, rosemary and thyme for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the mushrooms and sage and cook for 2-3 minutes, then remove from the heat, transfer to a large bowl and set aside to cool. (Reserve two tablespoon of this mixture for the gravy.)
Toast the nuts in the oven for 8-10 minutes (keep an eye on them as they burn really easily). Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
Blend the nuts in a food processor to a coarse powder and add to the leek mixture with the cheese. Mix until well combined and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Stir in the eggs until well combined.
For the pastry, heat the water and butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat until the butter melts and the mixture just boils.

Tear off one-fifth of the pastry and set aside, then knead the remaining pastry briefly and roll out on a well-floured work surface into a 5mm/¼in thick circle.
Flour the top of the dough, fold into four, and use it to line the 18cm/7in springform cake tin. Put the folded dough into the tin with the pointed end towards the middle, then unfold the dough so that the excess falls over the side (the dough will be quite fragile). Now ease the dough into the corners of the tin. If the dough tears, squeeze it back together again, this pastry is very forgiving.
Trim the pastry, leaving a 1cm/½in border.
Spoon half of the filling into the tin, pressing it down tightly with a wooden spoon. Tip over the dried cranberries, press down a little and finish with the rest of the pie filling, pressing down well.
Brush any exposed pastry with the beaten egg.
Roll the reserved pastry into a circle, and using the cake tin as a guide, cut out a circle with a 1cm/½in border.
Place the pastry over the top of the tin and squeeze or crimp the lid onto the pie to seal it, trimming any excess. Cut a slit in the middle of the pie to let any steam escape and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
Remove the pie from the oven and carefully remove the tin. Slide the pie onto a baking tray and glaze the top and sides of the pie with the beaten egg, then return to the oven for a further 15 minutes, or until golden-brown.
Remove the pie from the oven, glaze the top again and top with the frozen cranberries. Return to the oven for a further 5-10 minutes.
Meanwhile, for the gravy, melt the butter in a saucepan and add the reserved mushroom and leek mixture followed by the tomato purée. Stir on a low heat for 2 minutes, or until it changes colour to a deeper shade of brown.
Add the yeast extract, flour and rosemary then gradually add the stock. Bring to the boil, then season with salt pepper and brown sugar.

Remove the lid, lift the pork out of the slow cooker and onto a board, and leave it to stand for 10 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Very carefully, snip off the string and slide a knife, in a horizontal sawing motion, between the ham rind and fat, then lift off the rind, leaving a thin layer of fat on the meat. (You may need to do this in strips.)
Lightly score the ham fat with a knife in a crisscross pattern. Line a small roasting tin with a piece of foil, large enough to come up the sides of the tin. Place the ham on top, fat-side up. If the ham is thinner one end than the other, prop the short end up with a wodge of crumpled kitchen foil, so the fat is more horizontal – this will help it brown more evenly.
Mix the mustard, honey and sugar in a small bowl and spread it all over the ham fat. Bring the foil in towards the ham to create a bowl to catch any sticky juices. Bake the ham for 12–15 minutes, or until the fat is nicely browned.
Serve in slices, warm or cold.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/slow-cooker_roast_ham_25878_16x9.jpg
